 ## Git/Linux Tutorial

===================

### 1st Step - Create a Folder/File and Fork & Clone our repository

#### Create a folder and a file
```bash
pwd                                // Let’s see where we are 
ls                                    // List all the folders/files of our location
mkdir  GitTutorial           // Create a folder(pick a place you feel comfortable with) 
cd GitTutorial                 // Go into that folder
touch  README.md      // Create a read me file
vim README.md	  // Edit read me file. Press i to insert, esc+:+wq  (wq = write quit)(Will also create the file if it didn't exist)
cat README.md      //Preview the file
rm README.md 	  // Remove our masterpiece
```
#### Fork the repository on github (MUST DO THIS STEP BEFORE CLONING)

#### Clone the repository in the folder you created

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/GIT-Linux-Tutorial.git. //forked version
```
### 2nd Step - Push code

#### Pick a file and fix the error
Use a code editor to edit or you can use vim(use vim if you don’t have a code editor).

##### Instructions for vim(text editor in terminal)
```bash
vim nameoffile
```
It will opent vim in the terminal and you’ll see the file. 
You need to press ‘i’ on your keyboard to be able to edit it.
To save your work you have to press esc then ‘:’ and then type wq  (which mean write quit).
If you didn’t want to write to the file and you just wanted to read you can just do :q

#### Git commands (after you fixed the files and saved them)

```bash
git add . 
git commit -m “First Commit by yourname”
git push // this won’t work right away if you didn’t do the config
```

##### Config command(in your terminal it should tell you exactly what to do, follow those)
```bash
git config --global --edit
git commit --amend --reset-author
```
Now you can git push! 
Go check on your github your changes!

### 3rd Step - Create your branch and fix more errors from a different files

#### Create a branch
Tip: A big benefit to create branch is to unit test your code in the branch before you merge it with master

```bash
git checkout -b YourName 
```

#### Fix the errors in Homepage.html
Hint:  it says 3 errors, but technically you can only fix 2 in the code . The third one you have to add something to your folder .

#### Push your changes to your branch 
```bash
git status
git add .
git commit -m “ Fixed blabla”
git push --set-upstream origin nameofyourbranch 
git log
```
### 4th Step - Pull request
#### Go back to Github
It’ll say pull request click on that
### 5th step - Issue (Optional) 
#### Issue
I wrote an issue you can directly go and discuss it with me if you want.

### Was this too easy?
